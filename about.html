My name is Ariel Seruya, I was born on October 14th,1992, in Israel. When I a baby my family moved to Mar Del Plata, Argentina, and I spent the first five years of my life there. My parents decided to go back to our country, Israel, so when I was five years old we moved back to Israel.</p>

            After I graduated from high school, I decided to volunteer for a year with kids and youth that their background is low-income families. As a kid, when we just got back from Argentina my family had many years of financial struggles. This type of experience created a hunger to help kids that grow up the same as I did.

            Then, a year later, I joined the Israeli army to the Special Forces and I served for three years. My service was incredibly challenging, and I've experienced the unique brotherhood that you only can get as a combat soldier. Being a soldier teaches you how to be independent, and to trust yourself that nothing is impossible. I must be grateful for these three years of experience and memories. It was the best school for life that I could ask for.

   During my service in the army, I started thinking about traveling for at least a year in South and Central America. The service was strict and intense, so I wanted to taste some freedom after it. It took me two years to save the money for my traveling and to be sure that I have enough for the returning home after my travels. Traveling for me was profound, it's like another dimension opened up for me. As I mentioned beforehand, I didn't have the money for traveling outside my country when I was younger, so it's was like being a kid in a candy shop. My army service combined with my travels changes my perception of how I want to live my life. My first major step after coming back from my travels was to open up my business in real estate, which was focused on real estate development and project management. The business is still running in Israel under the management of one of my closest friends, while I oversee everything from across the ocean.
