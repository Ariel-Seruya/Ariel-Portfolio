        <h2>Raster Image </h2>
        <img src="A-Seruya-Raster600.jpg">
        <p> I choose this images of mine from different situations during my life, each one of the photos was from my traveling around the world. The first image is the one on the background, this picture was taken in Peru in one the most beautiful track is the world. The track called Huayhuash, it takes eight days to accomplish it. The hardest part in the track is the altitude, Most of it is between 4000 to almost 6000 meters high. The second image is me jumping on the street in Scranton PA. It was when I was a camp counselor, we had a day off and we decided to explore the towns around us. Being a councilor in camp was one an amazing experience, and actually it was my first time in America. The last photo was taken in Joshua Tree CA. Seven months ago when the pandemic just started, we were supposed to travel to California only for a week, and we found ourselves stuck with no flight back home to NYC.  Luckily, we have family there, so we had an amazing two months in the high desert in Joshua tree. </p>
       
        <h2>Vector Image</h2>
        <img src="A-Seruya-Vector600.png">
        <p> this image was taken in Joshua Tree, CA, during the corona outbreak this year. I choose many colors for this image, because I think it reflects our world from within. In each person there so many colors inside, and sometimes our only way to express is is by creation of something external. For example many artist express themselves with drawing on their canvas, but through the painting you can see their true colors and emotions. I chose stars because I think that each one of us is a star, each one of us can shine bright above any obstacle of life.  One of the most unique things in New York city is that the diversity of people, for me living here thought me a lot about the human experience, and the image is my way to express it.
